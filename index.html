			<h3>Web Designer, Web Developer, Dev Mountain student; Family Man.</h3>
			<p>I like to try a bit of everything. I enjoy computers, but also the outdoors. I'm a student in web design and web development and meanwhile I work at a physical therapy clinic.</p>
			<p>As an aide at a physical therapy office I am often asked about why I am going into computer science. It is because I mean to change the world for the better with it. I'm not 100% sure how, but there in this field there is limitless potential, only limited by our own imaginations.</p>
